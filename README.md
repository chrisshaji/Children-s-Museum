# Children's Museum Exhibit
A fun and interactive exhibit for the Children's Museum at Brazos Valley.

## Brainstorming
We were tasked with revamping the whole right side of the exhibit as the kids did not find it engaging. It was just a ball going down the sprial path shown below.
We were given complete creative freedom as long as the budget stays under $500. After a some brainstorming, we came up with a few ideas: replace the spiral path
with a box, attach sliders so that you can control the path of the ball as it comes down. The ball would make its way to a ball catch that we remade since the old one 
was broken. We decided to build an Archimedes screw to show kids how the ancient Greeks managed to lift water uphill without using a pump.

## Design and Fabrication
For the walls, we bought acryllic from home depot and used the Fischer Engineering Design Center (FEDC) @ Zach to laser cut the parts. There were two sets of fixtures that would hold the
acryllic in place top and bottom that were made out of wood. We simply used a table saw to cut a small divot across the wood block and simply slid in the acrylic and secured it with acrylic bonder. For the sliders, there were 3 components to it: the outer piece, inner pieces, and the sliding platform itself. They were 3D printed and toleranced, and spray painted to give the exhibit some extra color. The ball catch and the archimedes screw were also 3D printed.
